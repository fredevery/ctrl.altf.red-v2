# RULE NUMBER 1! - Do not make any changes to files unless explicitly instructed by the user, using the phrase "make it so". All suggested changes need to be reviewed and approved by the user before implementation.

- Refer to instructions in the `.github/instructions` directory for guidance on how to use this repository.
- Refer to `PROJECT_PLAN.md` for the project plan and progress.
- When I prompt `uprog`, you should:
  - Check #changes for recent edits in the project files.
  - Update the `PROJECT_PLAN.md` file to reflect the current status and any changes made.
  - Apply the changes as if I had prompted "make it so".
  - Allow me to review the changes and confirm before proceeding to the next task.
- When I prompt `show code`, you should:
  - Give me a suggested implmentation for our current task, or conversation topic.
