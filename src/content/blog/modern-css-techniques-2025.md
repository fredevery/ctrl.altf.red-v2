# Modern CSS Techniques for 2025

CSS continues to evolve rapidly, bringing new features that make styling web applications more powerful and efficient. Let's explore the latest techniques that are changing how we approach CSS in 2025.

## Container Queries

Container queries allow elements to respond to their container's size rather than the viewport size, enabling true component-based responsive design.

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

## Cascade Layers

Cascade layers provide better control over CSS specificity and make stylesheets more maintainable.

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .button {
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  }
}
```

## CSS Nesting

Native CSS nesting is now widely supported, reducing the need for preprocessors.

```css
.card {
  padding: 1rem;

  & .title {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  &:hover {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
}
```

## Subgrid

Subgrid allows nested grid items to participate in their parent's grid, creating more flexible layouts.

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}

.child {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

These modern CSS features are making it easier than ever to create beautiful, maintainable stylesheets. Start incorporating them into your projects today!
