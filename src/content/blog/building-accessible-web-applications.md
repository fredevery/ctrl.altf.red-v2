# Building Accessible Web Applications

Accessibility is not just a nice-to-have featureâ€”it's a fundamental requirement for creating inclusive web experiences. This guide covers the essential principles and practices for building accessible applications.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Legal compliance**: Many countries require digital accessibility
- **Wider audience**: Reach users with diverse abilities and needs
- **Better UX**: Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **SEO benefits**: Semantic HTML helps search engines understand content

## Key Principles (WCAG 2.1)

### 1. Perceivable

- Provide text alternatives for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable to different presentations

### 2. Operable

- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Avoid content that causes seizures

### 3. Understandable

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

- Maximize compatibility with assistive technologies
- Use valid, semantic HTML

## Practical Implementation Tips

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide proper ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test color contrast ratios

Remember: accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time checklist!
