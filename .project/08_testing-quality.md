# Testing & Quality Strategy

## Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Test individual components and utility functions.
  - Target: 80%+ code coverage for utilities and business logic
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Test component interactions and data flow.
  - Focus on data fetching, state management, and component composition
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  
  - Simulate user flows (navigation, form submission, etc.) in the browser.
  - Cover critical user journeys: home → projects → contact
- **Accessibility Tests:**  
  - Automated checks for WCAG compliance.
  - Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Performance Testing

- **Lighthouse CI:** Automated performance audits in CI/CD pipeline
- **Core Web Vitals:** Monitor and test LCP, FID, CLS metrics
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay): < 100ms  
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1
- **Bundle Analysis:** Track bundle size growth and identify bloat
- **Image Optimization:** Validate WebP/AVIF conversion and loading performance

## Visual Testing

- **Percy/Chromatic:** Visual regression testing for UI components (optional)
- **Storybook:** Component documentation and isolated testing environment
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Manual verification on target browsers
- **Responsive Testing:** Automated viewport testing across devices

## Tools & Libraries

- **Vitest:** Unit and integration testing for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **React Testing Library:** Test React components in a user-centric way.
- **Cypress:** End-to-end testing in the browser.
- **axe-core / jest-axe:** Automated accessibility testing.
- **Lighthouse CI:** Performance testing in CI/CD
- **Storybook:** Component development and testing

## What to Test

### Component Testing
- All page components render correctly and handle props/state.
- Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully.
- Loading states and skeleton screens display correctly.
- Dark/light mode toggle works across all components.

### Navigation & Routing
- Navigation works as expected across all pages.
- 404 pages display for invalid routes.
- Internal links work correctly.
- External links open in new tabs with proper rel attributes.

### Content & Data
- Blog and project content loads and displays as intended.
- Markdown rendering works correctly with all supported syntax.
- RSS feed generates valid XML.
- Search and filtering functionality works correctly.

### Forms & Interactions
- Forms validate and submit data correctly.
- Error messages display appropriately.
- Success states provide clear feedback.
- Rate limiting prevents spam submissions.

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements.
- ARIA labels and landmarks are properly implemented.
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio).
- Screen reader compatibility verified.
- Focus management works correctly.

### SEO & Meta Data
- Meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data render correctly.
- Sitemaps generate properly.
- Canonical URLs are set correctly.
- Image alt text is present and descriptive.

## Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests:** 80%+ coverage for utilities, hooks, and business logic
- **Integration Tests:** All critical user flows covered
- **E2E Tests:** Happy path scenarios for each page type
- **Accessibility Tests:** 100% of interactive components tested
- **Performance Tests:** All pages meet Core Web Vitals targets

## Continuous Integration

- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Run linting, type checking, and unit tests
- **Pull Request Checks:** 
  - All tests must pass
  - Coverage thresholds must be met
  - Lighthouse CI performance checks
  - Accessibility audit results
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Full test suite runs before deployment

## Quality Assurance

- Run all tests before deployment.
- Use CI/CD to automate test runs on pull requests.
- Regularly audit accessibility and performance (monthly).
- Monitor real-world performance metrics post-deployment.
- Review and update test coverage quarterly.

## Testing Environment Setup

- **Local Development:** Jest/Vitest watch mode for rapid feedback
- **CI Environment:** Full test suite with parallel execution
- **Staging Environment:** E2E tests against production-like data
- **Performance Testing:** Lighthouse CI with performance budgets
