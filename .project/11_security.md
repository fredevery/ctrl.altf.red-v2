# Security Considerations

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

- **Configure CSP headers** for XSS protection in Cloudflare Pages settings
- **Whitelist external resources:**
  - Google Fonts: `fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`
  - Analytics: Plausible or Vercel Analytics domains
  - Images: Allow `data:` URIs for optimized images
- **Disable inline scripts** except for necessary Next.js chunks
- **Report violations** to monitoring endpoint for security insights

## Form Security

- **CSRF Protection:** Use Next.js built-in CSRF tokens for contact forms
- **Input Validation:**
  - Server-side validation with Zod schemas
  - Sanitize all user inputs before processing
  - Email validation with proper regex patterns
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Implement form submission limits (e.g., 5 submissions per hour per IP)
  - Use Cloudflare Workers for edge-based rate limiting
- **Spam Protection:**
  - Honeypot fields for bot detection
  - Optional: reCAPTCHA integration for high-traffic periods

## Dependencies & Supply Chain

- **Regular Security Audits:**
  - Run `npm audit` before every deployment
  - Fix high/critical vulnerabilities immediately
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Enable Dependabot for automated security updates
  - Pin exact versions in production builds
  - Review dependency licenses for compliance
- **Lock File Security:**
  - Commit `package-lock.json` to prevent dependency confusion
  - Use `npm ci` in CI/CD for reproducible builds

## Cloudflare Security Features

- **DDoS Protection:** Enable Cloudflare's automatic DDoS mitigation
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
  - Enable managed rulesets for common attacks
  - Configure custom rules for specific threats
- **SSL/TLS Configuration:**
  - Enforce HTTPS with automatic redirects
  - Use modern TLS versions (1.2 minimum, prefer 1.3)
  - Enable HSTS headers with appropriate max-age
- **Bot Management:**
  - Enable Cloudflare Bot Management for automated threat detection
  - Configure challenge pages for suspicious traffic

## Data Protection & Privacy

- **Personal Data Handling:**
  - Minimize data collection (only essential contact information)
  - No persistent storage of user data beyond form submissions
  - Clear data retention policies in privacy notice
- **Analytics Privacy:**
  - Use privacy-focused analytics (Plausible recommended)
  - No tracking cookies without consent
  - Respect Do Not Track headers
- **GDPR/Privacy Compliance:**
  - Include privacy policy for EU visitors
  - Provide contact information for data requests
  - Document data processing activities

## Development Security

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Never commit secrets to version control
  - Use `.env.local` for development secrets
  - Rotate API keys regularly
- **Code Security:**
  - Use TypeScript for type safety
  - Enable strict ESLint security rules
  - Regular code reviews for security issues
- **Git Security:**
  - Use signed commits where possible
  - Protected main branch with required reviews
  - Scan for secrets in commit history

## Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Security Monitoring:**
  - Set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns
  - Monitor failed authentication attempts
  - Track CSP violation reports
- **Error Handling:**
  - Never expose sensitive information in error messages
  - Log security events for investigation
  - Implement graceful degradation for security failures
- **Incident Response Plan:**
  - Document steps for security incident handling
  - Maintain contact list for security notifications
  - Regular backup and recovery procedures

## Security Headers

Configure these security headers in Cloudflare Pages:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

## Regular Security Audits

- **Monthly:** Dependency vulnerability scan
- **Quarterly:** Full security review of codebase and infrastructure
- **Annually:** Third-party security assessment (if budget allows)
- **Ongoing:** Monitor security advisories for used technologies
