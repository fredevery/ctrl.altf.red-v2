- **Alt Text:** Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes

## Code Optimization

- **Bundle Splitting:** Leverage Next.js automatic code splitting
- **Dynamic Imports:** Use for heavy components and third-party libraries
- **Tree Shaking:** Remove unused code during build process
- **Minification:** Enable in production builds
- **Compression:** Use Brotli/Gzip compression via Cloudflare

## Asset Optimization

- **Font Loading:** 
  - Use `next/font` for Google Fonts with automatic optimization
  - Preload critical fonts with `font-display: swap`
  - Subset fonts to include only required characters
- **CSS Optimization:**
  - Critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
  - Remove unused Tailwind CSS classes in production
  - Use CSS containment where applicable
- **JavaScript Optimization:**
  - Minimize third-party scripts

## Caching Strategy

- **Static Assets:** Long-term caching (1 year) with versioned filenames
- **HTML Pages:** Short-term caching (5 minutes) with stale-while-revalidate
- **API Routes:** Cache responses where appropriate
- **CDN Caching:** Leverage Cloudflare's global CDN for static assets
- **Browser Caching:** Optimize cache headers for different asset types

## Loading Performance

- **Critical Resource Prioritization:**
  - Preload critical fonts and images
  - Defer non-critical JavaScript
  - Optimize critical rendering path
- **Resource Hints:**
  - Use `preconnect` for external domains
  - Use `dns-prefetch` for third-party resources
  - Use `prefetch` for likely next page resources
- **Progressive Loading:**
  - Show content as it becomes available
  - Implement skeleton screens for loading states
  - Use progressive enhancement principles

## Runtime Performance

- **React Optimization:**
  - Use React.memo for expensive components
  - Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
  - Implement proper key props for lists
- **State Management:**
  - Minimize component re-renders
  - Use local state over global state where possible
  - Debounce expensive operations (search, API calls)
- **Memory Management:**
  - Clean up event listeners and intervals
  - Optimize large data structures
  - Monitor memory usage in development

## Monitoring & Measurement

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):**
  - Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Monitor performance across different devices and networks
  - Track performance regressions over time
- **Synthetic Monitoring:**
  - Lighthouse CI in development pipeline
  - Regular performance audits
  - Performance budgets enforcement
- **Analytics Integration:**
  - Track page load times
  - Monitor bounce rates and user engagement
  - Correlate performance with user behavior

## Performance Budgets

- **JavaScript Bundle Size:** < 250KB initial load
- **CSS Bundle Size:** < 50KB initial load
- **Total Page Weight:** < 500KB for critical pages
- **Font Loading:** < 100KB total font weight
- **Image Optimization:** < 200KB for hero images

## Network Optimization

- **HTTP/2 Optimization:**
  - Leverage server push for critical resources
  - Optimize request multiplexing
  - Minimize request/response overhead
- **Compression:**
  - Enable Brotli compression for text assets
  - Optimize image compression ratios
  - Use appropriate compression for different file types
- **Connection Optimization:**
  - Minimize DNS lookups
  - Use connection pooling efficiently
  - Optimize SSL handshake performance

## Development Workflow

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Run Lighthouse audits during development
  - Profile components with React DevTools
  - Monitor bundle size changes in pull requests
- **Optimization Tools:**
  - Bundle analyzer for identifying bloat
  - Performance profiling tools
  - Network throttling for testing slow connections
- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Regular performance reviews
  - Performance-focused code reviews
  - Keep up with Next.js performance best practices
